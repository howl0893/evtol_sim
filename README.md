# eVTOL Simulation
![Build Status](https://github.com/howl0893/evtol_sim/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

## Problem Overview

There are five companies developing eVTOL aircraft. The vehicle produced by each manufacturer has different characteristics. <br/>
Six distinct properties are laid out in the below table:

| Company Name                    | Alpha Company | Bravo Company | Charlie Company | Delta Company | Echo Company |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Cruise Speed (mph)              |      120      |      100      |       160       |      90       |      30      |
| Battery Capacity (kWh)          |      320      |      100      |       220       |      120      |      150     |
| Time to Charge (hours)          |      0.6      |      0.2      |       0.8       |      0.62     |      0.3     |
| Energy use at Cruise (kWh/mile) |      1.6      |      1.5      |       2.2       |      0.8      |      5.8     |
| Passenger Count                 |      4        |      5        |       3         |      2        |      2       |
| Probability of fault per hour   |      0.25     |      0.10     |       0.05      |      0.22     |      0.61    |

You will simulate using these vehicle for 3 hours. Of course your simulation should take much less time than that.  <br/>
20 total vehicles should be deployed, and a random number of each type of vehicle should be used (with the total between all five types being 20). <br/>

There are only three chargers available for all 20 vehicles! A single charger can only be used by one vehicle at a time.  <br/>
Assume the chargers can charge the batteries in the Time to Charge time listed for each vehicle.  <br/>

Keep track of the following statistics per vehicle type:  <br/>
- average flight time per flight  <br/>
- average distance traveled per flight  <br/>
- average time charging per charge session  <br/>
- total number of faults  <br/>
- total number of passenger miles.  <br/>
	For example, if there are 2 vehicles carrying 4 passengers on a vehicle that cruises for 1 hour at 100 mph, total number of passenger miles is 2 * 4 * 1 * 100 = 800.

Assume that:
- Each vehicle starts the simulation with a fully-charged battery
- Each vehicle instantaneously reaches Cruise Speed
- Each vehicle is airborne for the full use of the battery, and is immediately in line for the charger after running out of battery power.

Please include the statistics recorded during at least one run of the simulation in your submission.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to ask any questions about the problem!  <br/>
However, if you find yourself making an assumption that we haven’t explained explicitly, you may simply document your assumption.  <br/>
It’s interesting to us to hear what assumptions you made and why.


## Design Rationale (OOP, modularity)
- **OOP:** Used `VehicleType` for static properties, `Vehicle` for instance state, and `Simulator` for orchestration, ensuring encapsulation and modularity.
- **Testability:** Basic unit tests validate range, initial state, and charging logic.
- **Modularity:** Classes are independent, allowing easy extension (e.g., new vehicle types).

## Assumptions
- Faults increment a counter but don’t affect flight behavior.
- 0.1-hour time step used for simulation granularity.
- Vehicles wait in queue until a charger is free; no priority applied.

## To-Do
- Add wait time tracking for charger queue (Issue #5).
- Expand unit tests for fault and queue behavior (Issue #7).
- Update documentation with git workflow (Issue #6).

## Build Instructions

1. Install CMake
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake
```

2. Verify
```
cmake --version
```

3. Navigate to build directory:
```
cd ~/dev/sandbox/c++/evtol_sim/build
```

4. Clean and reconfigure:
```
rm -rf *
cmake ..
make
```

5. Run
```
./evtol_sim
```
